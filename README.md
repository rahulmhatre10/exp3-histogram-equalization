A digital image is a two-dimensional matrix of two spatial coordinates, with each cell specifying the intensity level of the image at that point. So, we have an N x N matrix with integer values ranging from a minimum intensity level of 0 to a maximum level of L-1, where L denotes the number of intensity levels.
